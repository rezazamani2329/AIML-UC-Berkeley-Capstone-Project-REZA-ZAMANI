# 1- Business Understanding 

###   **1-1-Main Research Question**  
-  **Can Machine Learning models accurately predict whether credit card customers will default or not?**

###  **1-2-Other Research Questions**   
- **What are the main factors affecting the probability of default by customers?**

- **what are the relative importance of factors affecting the probability of default by customers?**

###  **1-3-Problem Statement** 
Customers and also managers of financial institutions- a credit card financial institutions - want to have a better understanding of the factors that impact credit card payment default and get a solution in place that can predict with high accuracy whether customers will default on payments.

To solve this problem we use a dataset that contains credit card payment information and it is our task to determine what factors impact payment default as well as build a model or an ensemble of models that can predict default.

From the standpoint of risk management, the predictive accuracy of the predicted chance of default will be more valuable than the binary outcome of classification - credible or not credible clients. We must determine which clients will fall behind on their credit card payments. Financial dangers are demonstrating a trend regarding commercial bank credit risk as the financial industry has improved dramatically. As a result, one of the most serious risks to commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. The current project is being created in order to analyses and predict the above-mentioned database. This research aims to identify credit card consumers who are more likely to default in the next month.

###  **1-4-Main Goal** 
- **Using AIML models, predict whether credit card customers will default or not**

###  **1-5-Other Goals** 
- **Determine main features have the highest impact on credit card default**

- **Understand the relationship between features together**

- **Understand the mechanism through which features affect default payment as target variable**

# **3- Engineering Features** 
- 1- check the dataset info to be sure have all data or do not have extra 

- 2- Split the data into features and target

- 3- Identify `categorical and numerical columns`

- 4- `Encode the target variable` with `LabdelEncoder()`

- 5- `OneHotEncoder` fo categorical and `StandardScaler()` for numerical variables 

#  **4- Train/test split and Handling Imbalanced Datasets** </span>  
##  **4-1-Train/Test Split** 
With data prepared, we split it into a train and test set.

##  <span style="color: red; "> **4-2-SMOTE method for Imbalanced Dataset** </span>  
<div style="background-color: LightPink; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"> 
 Our target variable in imbalance, then we should use the approach attention to this.

There are different approaches to split imbalance classification. Here are some of them 

1. **Oversampling**
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)
- Random Oversampling (Simply duplicates minority class instances)
2. **Undersampling**
- Random Undersampling
- Tomek Links (Removes borderline samples)
- NearMiss (Keeps only the hardest-to-classify examples)
3. **Hybrid Methods**
- SMOTE + Tomek Links
- SMOTE + Edited Nearest Neighbors (ENN)
4. **Class Weighting**
5. **Algorithm-Level Methods**
6. **Data Augmentation**

### We choose SMOTE

#### 1. <span style="color: red; ">  **At first we split data into train and test, then applied SMOTE, then model does not have data leakage**  </span>  
#### 2. <span style="color: red; ">  **Moreover, in this project, we find that if we apply SMOTE before splitting the data, we will have overfitting or underfitting, I Learn it from my supervisor in UC Berkeley**</span>  
#### 3. <span style="color: red; ">  **As we applying train/test at first, then applying SMOTE, we do not have data leakage and also check and find there is not any overfitting**</span>  

# <span style="color: red; ">  **5- Machine learning Models** </span> 
Strategy:

- 1-At first we define and fit each model
- 1- in each model, we see accuracy
- 2- in each model, we see classification report
- 3- check train score, test score, fitting time, precision, recall and f1
- 4- create dataframe to see all score together
- 5- with attention to all criteria, choose the best model in this step
- 6- we do not tune the models in this section, we will tune the models in next section

### **Other findings:**
### 4- **History of payment**:
- it is generally important as its elements have relatively high raking in SHAP and **three among top five ranking** (`PAY_SEP`, `PAY_ARP`, `PAY_AUG` ) are among top five features
### 5- **PAY_AMT**:
- among different months, **April** has the **highest impact**, followed by **September**
### 6- **BILL-AMT**: 
- bill amount of **September** has the **highest impact** among BILL_AMT, followed by April
### 7- **Among months**:
- **previous month is most important**.
-  We have the feature for each six previous months (history of payment, last payment, and last bill). Among all six previous months, last month (in feature September) is most important, as PAY_AMT, BILL_AMNT_SEP, and PAY_AMNT_SEP have higher ranking from other months in similar situation.
### 8- **Among months**:
**sixth previous month is the second most important**.
- By following all features for each month in SHAP (history of payment, last payment, last bill), we find that after September, April in the second important month. It shows that as financial institution, if you want to check the condition of customer, at first see the previous month, then go and check the six previous months, as it is more important the other months.
### 9- **SEX**:
- In SHAP, Male has higher ranking than Female, but has lower ranking in feature important. When we look at carefully to the colors and value in SHAP, we find that the probability of default by Female is lower which is compatible with data understanding we have and with feature importance
### 10- **MARRIAGE**:
- in SHAP (in both of them), we have only `MARRIAGE_Married', but looking at to feature importance, we have married and single with higher ranking for marries. We also find in data understanding that single has lower risk than married. 
### 11- **EDUCATION**:
- in SHAP, we have only `EDUCATION_University` as important factor affecting target. Feature important also shows that university degree has higher ranking, followed by graduate school and higher school. This finding in compatible with data understanding.

# <span style="color: GREEN; ">  **Interpretation** of results from SHAP and feature importance: </span>

## <span style="color: red; "> **1- PAY_SEPT** <span style="color: black; ">
#### 1-1- Last month is very important. If someone has delay in last month in payment or default, the probability of default in next month will be very high.
#### 1-2- Therefore there is maximum risk of default. As financial institution, if you see your customer has default in last month, try to call him/her to prevent from default in next month.
#### 1-3- Moreover as we find in data understanding section, if someone has default for two months, it would be possible to continue default or delay for all months. There is a sharp increase in probability of default for from one month delay to two months delay in payment, which shows one month delay in critical month, if a cusotmer passes this critical point, the risk of default inceases sharply from 33% in first month delay to 69% in second month delay. 

## <span style="color: red; "> **2- LIMIT_BAL** <span style="color: GREEN; "> 
#### 2-1- it is an important feature affecting default.
#### 2-2- When this feature for a customer is increasing it means the customer is using more and more from credit card, which shows his debt are increasing. 
#### 2-3- Higher amount of credit card leads to higher risk of default. 
#### 2-4- As financial institution, when you see the trend of using credit card by customer and his/her family is increasing sharply, the probability of default is increasing too

## <span style="color: red; "> **3- AGE**  <span style="color: GREEN; ">
#### 3-1-Age is an important feature affecting the default payment
#### 3-2- Age group of 31-40 has the minimum probability of default, followed by age group of 21-30, 41-50 
#### 3-3- Age group of 71-80 has the maximum probability of default, followed by age group 61-70. 
#### 3-4 - As financial institution, you should more care from people who has more than 70 years of old.
#### 3-5- As financial institution, if you are conservative about default, you can more focus on people with age more than 60. 

### <span style="color: red; "> **Customers with very high risk of default:**
#### Age group 71-80 
### <span style="color: red; "> **Customers with high risk of default:**
#### Age group 61-70 
### <span style="color: red; ">**Customers with low risk of default**: 
#### Age group 31-40 
### <span style="color: red; "> **Age with middle risk of default**: 
#### 21-30, 41-60 

## **Other findings:**

### 4- **History of payment**: 
#### Previous behavior of each customer can act as proxy for next behavior. Behavior of customer in last month (`PAY_SEP`) and in six month before (`PAY_ARP`) are very important. It means if someone started in the last month to default or from the first month of our data started to default, he/she has higher probability to default again.

### 5- **BILL-AMT**: 
#### Moreover, the bill amount of last month is important too, higher bill amount in last month has positive impact on default in coming month.  

### 6- **Which month is important**:
#### We have three feature for each month, with attention to all information from SHAP, feature importance and data understanding:
#### - 6-1- **September** (last month)
#### - 6-2- **April** (first month)

#### This finding shows that if you want to check the behavior of customer check the first and last month behavior

### 7- **SEX**: 
#### Female has lower risk of default (21%) than Male (24%), but it is not so important factor.

### 8- **MARRIAGE**:
#### single people has the lowest level default (22%), followed by married (23%) and others (24%), but it is not important factor

### 9- **EDUCATION**: 
#### Customer with high school degree have the highest default (25%), followed by university degree (23%), and Graduate School (19%) and others (7%)

## <span style="color: red; "> **8-2- Deployment** </span>
Now that we have settled on our models and findings, it is time to deliver the information to the client.  I am organizing my work as a basic report that details my primary findings.  Keep in mind that my audience are financial companies interested in fine-tuning their strategy in debt market and are sensitive to the default of payment by customers.

<div style="background-color: LightPink; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;"> 


## <span style="color: red; "> **1- Why we can trust to AIML model and its results and predictions**
 #### <span style="color: black; "> Results of AIMl models are reliable, as our best and second best models have higher accuracy, recall, precision, f1 and ROC_AUC. All criteria are more than 80%, which shows results are acceptable. 

## <span style="color: red; "> **2- What are the most important factors affecting the risk of default?** 
<span style="color: black; "> Three top factors are affecting the risk of default are
- `AGE`,
- `PAY_SEPT`,
- and `LIMIT_BAL`

## <span style="color: red; "> **3- How `AGE` is affecting the `risk of default`, can you devide people with age on high, low and middle risk of payment?**

- categorize people on decade into 21-30, 31-40, ...., 71-80

- The probability of default for each group is as following: 
- AGE_GROUP `       ` Risk of default
- 21-30`               `0.22
- 31-40`               `0.20
- 41-50`               `0.23
- 51-60`               `0.25
- 61-70`               `0.26
- 71-79`               `0.33
###

- Level of risk `                 `Age Group 
- Low risk`                          `31-40 
- High risk`                         `71-80
- Middle risk`                       `51-60 
- Lower middle risk`                 `21-30, 41-50 
- Upper middle risk`                 `61-70 

## <span style="color: red; "> **4- How `PAY_SEPT` (history of last month) is affecting the `risk of default`?** 
#### Last month is very important. If someone has delay in last month in payment or default, the probability of default in next month will be very high.
#### Therefore, there is maximum risk of default. As financial institution, if you see your customer has default in last month, try to call him/her to prevent from default in next month.
#### Moreover, as we find in data understanding section, if someone has default for two months, it would be possible to continue default or delay for all months. There is a sharp increase in probability of default for from one month delay to two months delay in payment, which shows one month delay in critical month, if a customer passes this critical point, the risk of default increases sharply from 33% in first month delay to 69% in second month delay.

## <span style="color: red; "> **5- How `LIMIT_BAL` (using of credit card) is affecting the `risk of default`?** 
 
#### It is an important feature affecting default.
#### When this feature for a customer is increasing it means the customer is using more and more from credit card, which shows his debt are increasing. 
#### Higher amount of credit card leads to higher risk of default. 
#### As financial institution, when you see the trend of using credit card by customer and his/her family is increasing sharply, the probability of default is increasing too

## <span style="color: red; "> **6- How `History of payment` is affecting the `risk of default`?** 

#### Previous behavior of each customer can act as proxy for next behavior. Behavior of customer in last month (`PAY_SEP`) and in six month before (`PAY_ARP`) are very important. It means if someone started in the last month to default or from the first month of our data started to default, he/she has higher probability to default again.

## <span style="color: red; "> **7- How `BILL-AMT` is affecting the `risk of default`?** 
#### The bill amount of last month is important. Higher bill amount in last month has positive impact on default in coming month.  

## <span style="color: red; "> **8- Which `Month` has more valuable information about the `risk of default`?** 
#### We have three data for each month (history of payment, bill amount and pay amount). Generally two important months are: 
#### **`September`** (`last month`)
#### **`April`** (`first month`)
#### You should track this two months, they represents the behavior of customer
#### This finding shows that if you want to check the behavior of customer check the first and last month behavior

## <span style="color: red; "> **9- How `Gender (SEX) ` is affecting the `risk of default`?** 
#### Female has lower risk of default (21%) than Male (24%), but it is not so important factor.

## <span style="color: red; "> **10- How `MARRIAGE` is affecting the `risk of default`?** 
#### single has the lowest level default (22%), followed by married (23%) and others (24%), but it is not important factor

## <span style="color: red; "> **11- How `EDUCATION` is affecting the `risk of default`?** 
#### Customer with high school degree have the highest default (25%), followed by university degree (23%), and Graduate School (19%) and others (7%)
